# Tommy Logos

Logos for topics, things, software, operating systems, programming languages, and activities. These were originally created for use on [www.tommypkeane.com](https://www.tommypkeane.com), but are available for general use with attribution.

See `LICENSE` file for usage details.

All SVGs were created in Inkscape 1.x, and all files under the `plain` directory are exported SVG 1.1 compatible plain-SVG images that can be used in any vector-graphics renderer or editor.

## Usage

If you want to use the logos in this repository, you should use the version(s) under the `plain` directory.

We recommend that you directly inject/embed the raw SVG XML-code into your HTML file(s), so that you have the most flexible design available to you by giving you CSS access to the tags inside the SVG.

You can embed the images with the `<embed>`, `<object>`, or `<img>` tags, to varying degrees of flexibility in your site design.

Logos have fixed colors for fill and stroke aspects of the graphical elements. If you're looking for icons that can be used on a website and have adaptable coloring, you should look at the [tommy_tofu](https://github.com/TommyPKeane/tommy_tofu) repository.

## Derived Works (Editing)

If you wish to edit a logo's color-pallette or modify a design, you should use the files in the `inkscape` directory with Inkscape v1.0 or newer. Before injecting your updated design into a webpage, you should do a `"Save a copy..."` save of the file to a new name and choose `"Plain SVG (*.svg)"` as the output format.

Inkscape SVGs have information about the Inkscape GUI, extra file details, and extra namespace-tags to enhance and provide the features of the Inkscape editor. Contemporary web-browsers will usually ignore these tags when rendering SVGs, but they can certainly cause issues or unexpected formatting problems. They can especially be problematic on mobile browsers that are usually less advanced than desktop browsers.
